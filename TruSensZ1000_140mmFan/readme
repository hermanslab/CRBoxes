This DIY air filter uses a TruSens Z1000 HEPA filter and any 140 mm PC fan (like Artic P14). The bottom part (3D printed) can be used to close the bottom end of the filter. The top part closes the other side of the filter and 4 screws (included with most PC fan) can be used to screw the fan to the top part.

Costs: TruSens Z1000 25-30 EUR, Artic P14 5-10 EUR (fan guard 2-3 EUR), 3D printed parts depends if you print yourself or outsource.
