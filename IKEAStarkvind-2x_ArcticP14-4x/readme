This filter uses 2 very cheap IKEA Starkvind HEPA filters and 4 tethered Artic P14 fans. The 3D printed part (STL file) should be printed 4 times and can be assembled 2 x 2. The remaining sides are closed of using poster board (i.e., thin 5 mm), which can be cut manually. I used "Cathedral A1", but any brand would do.
